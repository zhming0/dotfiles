When writing code, you MUST follow these principles:

- Code should be easy to read and understand.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Functions should be small, ideally doing one thing. They should not exceed a few dozens of lines.
- Only use comments when necessary, as they can become outdated. Instead, strive to make the code self-explanatory.
- When comments are used, they should add useful information that is not readily apparent from the code itself.
- I prefer immutable, declarative, functional code over imperative code.
